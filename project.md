soo.?.

what project structure do i go towards,

I don't know much about web stuff, so i don't think i can do something like [livewallpaper](https://github.com/DaZiYuan/livewallpaper/)

but something offline with a daemon+foreground app (a bit like [my WTBC project](https://github.com/Bowarc/WTBC/)) is more of my skill range

On app launch, if the daemon is not started, it silently runs it.

The thing is.. users will probably don't want to download wallpapers themselves.
