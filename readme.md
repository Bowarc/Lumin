soo.?.

what project structure do i go towards,

I don't know much about web stuff, so i don't think i can do something like [livewallpaper](https://github.com/DaZiYuan/livewallpaper/)

but something offline with a daemon+foreground app (a bit like [my WTBC project](https://github.com/Bowarc/WTBC/)) is more of my skill range

On app launch, if the daemon is not started, it silently runs it.

The thing is.. users will probably don't want to download wallpapers themselves.


Is the daemon usefull ?

i might be for playlist but if you're only gonna set a single video in repeat-inf, it's not gonna do sht

I guess create stats ? that could be fun
